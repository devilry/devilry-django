Docs and help
=============
http://devilry.org should always be the starting point when looking for documentation or help.


Develop
=======
If you just want to get up a development environment to test out Devilry on you own machine,
read the developer section of our `developer docs <http://devilry.readthedocs.org>`_.


Health
======
The image below shows if our testsuite passes on the ``master`` branch. We do not release stable
versions with test failures. This health indicator is mainly useful for developers, or testers that want to try
out the latest development version.
