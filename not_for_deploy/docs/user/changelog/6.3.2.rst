What is new in Devilry 6.3.2

Updates/changes
###############
- Changed from ``.zip`` to ``.tar.gz`` for feedback feed archives. This change is done because:
    - Available ``.tar.gz`` support in the underlying systems is better in terms of memory
      usage, integration with large scale file storage (blob storage) and local storage usage.
      In short, this makes it easier to host Devilry on modern server infrastructure.
    - Windows 11, macOS and Linux all support this format.
- First class support for blob storage (large scale redundant file storage).
- Lots of cleanup in the devilry codebase.
