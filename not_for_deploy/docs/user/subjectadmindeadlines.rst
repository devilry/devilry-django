Overview of the deadline view
#############################

The image below is a typical deadline overview. Each of the red-marked areas
is explained below the image.

.. image:: images/subjectadmin/deadlines.png


Add deadline (hilighted with a red circle)
==========================================
Click the Add deadline button to a add deadline to one or more groups. You can
select individual groups, and Devilry has shortcuts for a couple of common
choices.


Expand/collapse deadline (hilighted by a red arrow)
===================================================
Deadlines start out collapsed when you enter a view. Click the deadline to
expand or collapse it.


Move/edit deadline (hilighted by a red rectangle)
=================================================
To move or edit (the about-text for) a deadline, expand the deadline, and
select the edit-button.

You can change the deadline for only some of the groups
within the deadline, effectively splitting the deadline in two. This is
explained on the right-hand side of the list of groups that appear when you
choose that option.


Delete deadline (hilighted by a red rectangle)
==============================================
You can delete a deadline, but only superusers can delete deadlines where
groups have made deliveries.


Hard VS soft deadlines
######################
Soft or hard deadlines is configured on the left hand side in the assignment
overview under the *Deadline handling* heading. Use the *More info* button to
get detailed information about soft and hard deadlines.


What about examiners?
#####################
Examiners can add deadlines. It is a natural part of their workflow. Whenever
they fail a student, they are asked to do one of the following:

- Leave the student with a failing grade.
- Give them another chance --- create a new deadline.
