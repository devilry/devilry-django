Choose students that qualify for final exams
============================================



Quickstart
##########
We have an interractive guide for this on your right-hand side on the
Subjectadmin frontpage (see :ref:`findsubjectadminfrontpage`). Select
the guide, and follow its instructions.


How the qualified for final exams system works
##############################################
You select the students that qualify for final exams using one of the provided
plugins. Nodeadmins, or automatic exporters, read these lists to determine who
can participate in the final exams.

Students can see if they are qualified for exams or not, but they can not se
*why* they are qualified (they can not see what plugin was used, and with what
settings). You should use the course website, or other approprite channels to
inform your students about the requirements for final exams.


Changing or retracting
######################
You can retract or change a saved *qualified for final exams*-status.

.. warning::

    :ref:`Nodeadmins <role_nodeadmin>` are **not notified** when you retract or
    change a status. We are working on a system that handles
    updates/retracting, but that did not make it into the first release of the
    *Qualifies for final exams* app.

    Please notify the people coordinating final exams for your
    department/organizational unit if you change a status.

To change a status, simply use the button at the bottom of the box at the top
of the page showing a status.


No plugin fits my needs!
