The Examiner role
*****************

.. note:: Examiner is someone that writes feedback. Examiners are often one of these:

    - Someone responsible for correcting some or all students in a subject/course.
    - A teacher that corrects their own students. They are usually Period or
      Subject administrator in addition to Examiner.
    - Someone giving anonymous feedback on an exam.

What can an examiner do?
========================
Examiners can basically do anything non-destructive with groups (see
:ref:`group_candidate_student`) that they have been assigned to:

- View all feedback for the groups.
- Add new deadlines to their groups.
- Give feedback.
- Change feedback. Each change to the published feedback is
  logged, and the students can view *all* published feedback.

Examiners can not:

- Delete groups.
- Add new groups.
- Add or remove students to groups.
- Move deadlines. This is a missing feature, which will be implemented in a
  future release. It will be safe becuase students will remain protected
  because of logging of all changes. Moving deadlines is already implemented
  for administrators.
- Remove deadlines from groups. We will probably allow examiners to remove
  deadlines without deliveries when we start allowing them to move deadlines.
