    Devilry is truly open, not just Open Source, but we also try to keep all
    issues, suggestions and plans in the open. This means that your suggestions,
    bugs, problems, etc. is handled in the open, and readable by anyone.

    **via any of the contact channels** listed below (see the note above for why).

Anyone can add issues to our issue tracker at our GitHub project page. We use
the issue tracker for bugs, problems, suggested improvements, suggested new
features, etc.

You need to create a GitHub user to add an issue. You just have to write an
understandable title and description. We will then tag your issue, and respond
to your via comments on your issue. You should be notified for each new comments

Question and Answers forum
##########################

Visit: `The Devilry Help Questions and Answers forum`_.

We have a Question and Answer forum on Google Groups named Devilry Help. You
can post anything on this forum, including:

- help understanding Devilry --- no problem is too small for this forum
- suggest improvements --- even minor improvements
- report problems
- report bugs
- suggest new features

.. note::
    We recommend that you use the issue tracker instead of this
    forum if you have a well defined problem or suggestion.
    Even very small improvements or issues belong in the issue tracker, and
    they end up there even if you post them in the Q&A forum. The only
    difference is that someone else have to put them in the issue tracker,
    which may delay fixing the issue.


Your local Devilry support
##########################
The local Devilry support typically adds a link to a page with their contact
information in the help page. Click the question mark in the upper right corner
when logged in to Devilry, and look for a link to internal/organization specific
devilry documentation.


Contact email --- only for special cases
########################################

.. warning::

    This is only for contact requests that does not belong in the open contact
    channels, like the issue tracker, or in the Q&A forums. This mailinglist is
    typically for those that need private and direct contact with the Developers,
    and requests belonging in the other contact channels is ignored.

    The warning above about sensitive information is also for this list.
